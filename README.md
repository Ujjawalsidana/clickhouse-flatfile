# clickhouse-flatfile

I did the Frontend Work: HTML, CSS, Javascript
Backend Work: Python, Flask
Data I stored on clickhouse 
I shared the ingested file of dummy data.
I did the same on uk price data also but the data is too large y frontend is not giving all the rows and not storing that much large data into into csv So I did with the dummy file.
