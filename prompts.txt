How to find column name into table in ClickHouse using Flask?”

Used while trying to display the list of columns dynamically on the frontend after selecting a ClickHouse table.

Start ingestion button gets disappeared from the frontend. How do I fix it?

Prompted UI debugging and conditionally showing the ingestion button based on source selection.


“I’m getting error: No columns selected for ingestion. Upload and preview working alright but on clicking Start Ingestion in flatfile gives this error.”

Helped identify the issue that columns weren’t being rendered after uploading real data.

“Before I gave dummy data which had only three columns, but now the real CSV has 10–12 columns which are not visible on clicking start ingestion.”

Clarified the mismatch in frontend rendering and led to updating the column checkbox rendering logic.

“Give me the full compiled HTML code.”

Requested the complete working frontend layout integrating all backend-connected logic.
